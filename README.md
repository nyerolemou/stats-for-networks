## Introduction

Networks are becoming evermore prevalent, from social networks to transport networks, and it is becoming increasingly important to develop practical methods to analyse what can be extremely large datasets of this form.

This repo is a collection of notebooks created whilst taking the Oxford graduate course *Probability and Statistics for Network Analysis* in 2020 (taught by Prof. Gesine Reinert). It covers a few of the topics taught in the course and some from non-statistical network analysis:

- centrality measures
- summary statistics of graphs
- random graph models
- sampling from networks
- fitting a model
- community structures
- motifs

I'd previously worked with deterministic network analysis techniques but these are not practical when dealing with very large networks. Even just visualising the graph - i.e. knowing what your data actually looks like - can become unfeasible, nevermind using algorithms that assume complete knowledge of the network. So, my aim with this course was to develop some practical skills to analyse graphs using statistical techniques.
